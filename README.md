I used ChatGPT3 to find a tutorial to find the basics on how to do a to-do list 
I then came up with ways to show 3 examples of reusable components,
properties, reactive values, and control flow. While the tutorial I used did not involve the implementation of a Asynchronous Programming concept explicitaly to replace this I used 3 other examples that showcased #Binding, #Formatting, and #EventHandler which it was stated it was allowed on Ed. Moreover, I also used throughout other more common concepts such as #Classes, #Style, #Headings, #Attributes, and  #Stateful.
I worked on this with Sean Roades and he helpmed realize how to incorporate components and properties
